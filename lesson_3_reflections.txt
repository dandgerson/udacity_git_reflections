1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I prefer using a remote repository when i working on a project for my portfolio which i can show other people or for just public projects.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because I must have max freedom with my repositories whatever the local workplace or remote repositories on GitHub.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks we need when we want to contibute some project in GitHub context, and work with them in our local workplase.
  Clone we use when we need a project on our local machine exactly.
  Branch we use in context one project.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  The remote stored may had pushed more than one contributor if the remote store developed by the group of developers and up-to-date with it minimizing the branch conficts.
