1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I prefer using a remote repository when i working on a project for my portfolio which i can show other people or for just public projects.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because I must have max freedom with my repositories whatever the local workplace or remote repositories on GitHub.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks we need when we want to contibute some project in GitHub context, and work with them in our local workplase.
  Clone we use when we need a project on our local machine exactly.
  Branch we use in context one project.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  The remote stored may had pushed more than one contributor if the remote store developed by the group of developers and up-to-date with it minimizing the branch conficts.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    Without Git and GitHub collaborate is to harder and so much longer. The Git and GitHub is very usefull workflowy instruments and it's the best solution for collaborate. Without using Git and GitHub I'll probably used a Dropbox and Skype conversations, but it will be ugly.

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I've need a experimental changes or I collaboratte a project with other people, in this case I can send a pull request and ask a look for my changes my contributors. It's very usefull and easy.
